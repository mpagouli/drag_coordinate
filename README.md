Drag Coordinate 
=============

My first simple plugin: Having several divs containing larger divs inside them, drag_coordinate gives the ability to coordinate the dragging of the child divs inside their parents, in several ways. Dragging of one element can cause automatic dragging of another inside its own parent.
